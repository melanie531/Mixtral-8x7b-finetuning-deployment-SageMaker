    "In this sagemaker example, we are going to learn how to fine-tune [Mixtral 8x7B](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-v0.1) using [QLoRA: Efficient Finetuning of Quantized LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14314). [LLaMA 2](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-hf) is the next version of the [LLaMA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13971). Compared to the V1 model, it is trained on more data - 2T tokens and supports context length window upto 4K tokens. Learn more about LLaMa 2 in the [\"\"]() blog post.\n",

    "QLoRA is an efficient finetuning technique that quantizes a pretrained language model to 4 bits and attaches small “Low-Rank Adapters” which are fine-tuned. This enables fine-tuning of models with up to 65 billion parameters on a single GPU; despite its efficiency, QLoRA matches the performance of full-precision fine-tuning and achieves state-of-the-art results on language tasks.\n",

      "Swift signed a record deal with Big Machine Records in 2005 and released her eponymous debut album the following year. With 157 weeks on the Billboard 200 by December 2009, the album was the longest-charting album of the 2000s decade. Swift's second studio album, Fearless (2008), topped the Billboard 200 for 11 weeks and was the only album from the 2000s decade to spend one year in the top 10. The album was certified Diamond by the RIAA. It also topped charts in Australia and Canada, and has sold 12 million copies worldwide. Her third studio album, the self-written Speak Now (2010), spent six weeks atop the Billboard 200 and topped charts in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand.\n",

      "Her fourth studio album, Red (2012), was her first number-one album in the United Kingdom. It topped charts in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, and spent seven weeks at number one on the Billboard 200. Swift scored her fourth US number-one album with 1989 (2014), which topped the Billboard 200 for 11 weeks and was certified 9× Platinum by the RIAA. It topped the charts in other countries including Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. Her sixth studio album, Reputation (2017), made Swift the first music artist to have four consecutive albums each sell over one million copies within its debut week. It spent four weeks atop the Billboard 200.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exiting Big Machine, Swift signed with Universal Music Group label Republic Records in 2018. Her seventh studio album, Lover (2019), was the year's global best-selling album by a solo artist. Swift released two studio albums in 2020, Folklore and Evermore, which respectively spent eight and four weeks atop the Billboard 200. Swift released two re-recorded albums, Fearless (Taylor's Version) and Red (Taylor's Version), in 2021, after a dispute with Big Machine over the rights to the masters of her first six albums; the former was the first re-recorded album to top the Billboard 200. Swift's tenth original studio album, Midnights (2022), became her fifth to sell over a million US first-week copies; It was also the first album to sell over a million physical sales since 2015.

    "\n",
    "We are going to use the recently introduced method in the paper \"[QLoRA: Quantization-aware Low-Rank Adapter Tuning for Language Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685)\" by Tim Dettmers et al. QLoRA is a new technique to reduce the memory footprint of large language models during finetuning, without sacrificing performance. The TL;DR; of how QLoRA works is: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Quantize the pretrained model to 4 bits and freezing it.\n",
    "* Attach small, trainable adapter layers. (LoRA)\n",
    "* Finetune only the adapter layers, while using the frozen quantized model for context.\n",
    "\n",
    "We prepared a [run_clm.py](./scripts/run_clm.py), which implements QLora using PEFT to train our model. The script also merges the LoRA weights into the model weights after training. That way you can use the model as a normal model without any additional code. The model will be temporally offloaded to disk, if it is too large to fit into memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to create a sagemaker training job we need an `HuggingFace` Estimator. The Estimator handles end-to-end Amazon SageMaker training and deployment tasks. The Estimator manages the infrastructure use. \n",
    "SagMaker takes care of starting and managing all the required ec2 instances for us, provides the correct huggingface container, uploads the provided scripts and downloads the data from our S3 bucket into the container at `/opt/ml/input/data`. Then, it starts the training job by running.\n"
